<h1>User Story & Inter Flow - Steward To Steward Messaging</h1>

<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>As new steward user, I want to message other LL stewards to ask about LL setup, what books are most needed in our area and see if any steward has contacted the local library.</p>

<h2>Interaction Flow</h2>
<h3>Use case:</h3>
<p>Martha Mess is a homemaker that books and reading and wants to set up a LL in her neighborhood.  She has been set up as a steward and is ready to setup her LL.  She wants to contact other stewards to get advise on setting the LL up, getting books for it and if they have contacted the local library about posting events and LL locations.</p>

<h3>Precondition</h3>
<p>Martha Mess is on her iPhone and has signed into her steward account.  She is on the landing/home page.</p>

<h3>Postcondition</h3>
