<h1>User Story & Inter Flow - User Post Event</h1>

<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>As an intermediate technology user, I want to post an upcoming event at the library where I work.</p>

<h2>Interaction Flow</h2>
<h3>Use case:</h3>
<p>Dedre Kiplinger is a librarian and has a live reading event scheduled at her library next week.  Dedre has an active LL account and has been telling everyone coming into the library about the live event.  She does not have any fliers about the event and has been telling everyone to sign up for the LL app to find the event that will have the schedule of live reading times.  Dedre now needs to post the event on the LL app.</p>

<h3>Precondition</h3>
<p>Dedre Kiplinger is on her iPhone and has signed into the LL app and is looking at the landing page.</p>
