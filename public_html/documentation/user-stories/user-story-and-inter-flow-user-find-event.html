<h1>User Story & Inter Flow - User Find Event</h1>

<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>As a light technology user of the little library (LL) app, I want to find events close to my location in the next week.</p>


<h2>Interaction Flow</h2>
<h3>Use case:</h3>
<p>Evelyn Event is a retired late age adult who loves to read and believes in the LL project. Evelyn is using her Chromebook at home at the recommendation of the librarian at her local library. She has since signed up and is ready to use the app to find the next event to attend.</p>
<h3>Precondition:</h3>
<p>Evelyn Event is looking at the LL home page on her desktop and knows only the dates she is available to participate and that she prefers to stay within a 10-mile radius of her home.</p>
<h3>Postcondition:</h3>
<p>Evelyn Event has identified the next event she intends to participate in.</p>
<h3>Required Steps:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>User scrolls down the home page and finds the "Coming Events" section. After briefly looking over the listed events she single left-clicks the "Search for More Events" link below the "Featured Events" section.</li>
    <li>Interface directs her to the message board where the events are listed in a section above the standard User message board area. </li>
    <li>User identifies the "Filter By" drop down. She then single left-clicks it.</li>
    <li>Interface opens a dropdown menu allowing Evelyn to filter the events by date and/or location/district.</li>
    <li>User chooses the date and selects a 10-mile radius from her home. She presses the "Apply" button.</li>
    <li>Interface displays only the results matching her parameters.</li>
    <li>User compares her schedule with the options available and selects the event of her choosing before closing the window.</li>
   </ul>
