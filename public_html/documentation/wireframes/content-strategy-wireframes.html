	<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
	<p>This website will provide the local Albuquerque community with a tool to better connect neighborhoods to the Little Libraries and those who use them and maintain them.  Additionally, this application will encourage literacy and literary event planning, promotion and attendance. In addition, this site will:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Let users know, once they are logged in, what Little Libraries and public libraries are within walking distance</li>
		<li>The Who, What, When and Where of literacy and literary events</li>
		<li>The ability to search for specific types of Little Libraries</li>
		<li>The ability, as a Steward of a Little Library, to manage their Little Library</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The map is critical to the project and will be the central feature of the site.</p>
